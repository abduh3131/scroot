# Development Report

## Objective
Extend the autonomous scooter pilot with a multimodal large-model co-driver, a natural-language command interface, and accompanying documentation while keeping the stack ready for Jetson and Ubuntu deployments.

## Key Enhancements

1. **Multimodal Safety Advisor**
   - Added `autonomy/ai/advisor.py`, a BLIP + FLAN-T5 powered module that captions each frame, reasons over perception metadata, and issues traffic-law-compliant directives.
   - The advisor enforces emergency stops when high hazard levels are detected or when regulated objects (`stop sign`, `traffic light`, `person`, `bicycle`) appear in view.

2. **Command Parsing Pipeline**
   - Introduced `autonomy/ai/command_interface.py` to normalize operator inputs such as “drive 2 m forward” or “turn right”.
   - Commands can be injected once at launch (`--command`) or streamed live from a file (`--command-file`).

3. **Navigator + Controller Updates**
   - `Navigator.plan` now consumes high-level commands, biasing turns, regulating speed, and surfacing goal context metadata.
   - The controller honors enforced stops so the scooter brakes immediately when the advisor flags a hazard or the operator issues a stop command.

4. **Pilot Orchestration**
   - `AutonomyPilot` coordinates the new components, exports JSON state files for dashboards, and prints actuator commands alongside advisor directives.
   - Visualization overlays now display both actuator values and the latest advisory text for easier debugging.

5. **Tooling + Documentation**
   - Updated dependency checks and `requirements.txt` for Torch and Transformers workloads.
   - Refreshed the primary README and supplied this report for traceability.

## Testing Notes

- Runtime validation within this environment is limited because GPU-accelerated models (YOLO, BLIP, PyTorch) are not available. The code has been structured to fail fast if required packages are missing, and the launcher explicitly checks for them before execution.

## Next Steps

- Integrate localization and mapping data to fulfill “drive to this location” requests with metric precision.
- Explore quantized or distilled VLM/LLM variants for faster Jetson deployments.
- Add telemetry unit tests or simulation harnesses once model dependencies can be stubbed or mocked.
