# Minimal YOLO Pilot

A tiny, CPU-friendly pilot that reads a USB/CSI camera, runs YOLO object detection, converts detections into steering/throttle/brake, and optionally publishes the actuator triplet to ROS. Everything lives in `autonomy/` with no extra tooling.

See `REPORT.md` for requirements, setup, and run instructions.
