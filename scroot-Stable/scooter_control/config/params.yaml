# Configuration parameters for the scooter_control package

# --- Cruise Control Node ---
cruise_control:
  target_speed: 1.5      # m/s, desired cruising speed
  slowdown_distance: 3.0 # m, distance at which to start slowing down
  stop_distance: 0.5     # m, distance at which to issue a full stop
  lidar_frontal_angle: 20.0 # degrees, +/- angle from center to check for obstacles

# --- Lane Assist Node ---
lane_assist:
  # For OpenCV-based lane detection
  hsv_lower_thresh: [0, 0, 180]   # Lower HSV threshold for white/yellow lines
  hsv_upper_thresh: [255, 40, 255] # Upper HSV threshold
  steering_gain: 0.5             # Proportional gain for steering correction
  max_steering_angle: 0.52         # Radians (~30 degrees), max correction angle

# --- Object Avoidance Node ---
object_avoidance:
  lidar_arc_angle: 180.0 # degrees, the total field of view to check for avoidance paths
  smoothing_factor: 0.2  # Factor for exponential moving average to smooth steering (0-1)
  critical_obstacle_distance: 1.5 # m, distance within which avoidance takes high priority

# --- Dual YOLO Node ---
dual_yolo:
  yolo_s_frame_interval: 3 # Run YOLOv8s every Nth frame
  confidence_threshold_n: 0.4 # Confidence threshold for YOLOv8n
  confidence_threshold_s: 0.6 # Confidence threshold for YOLOv8s
  iou_threshold_fusion: 0.7 # IoU threshold to consider two boxes the same object

# --- Safety Supervisor Node ---
safety_supervisor:
  emergency_stop_distance: 0.3 # m, absolute minimum distance to any LiDAR point
  sensor_timeout: 0.5          # seconds, max time between sensor messages before stop
  
# --- Command Arbitrator Node ---
command_arbitrator:
  obstacle_timeout: 1.0 # seconds, how long to remember an obstacle for avoidance priority
